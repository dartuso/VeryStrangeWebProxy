<h1>Assignment 1: Fake News Proxy (40 marks)</h1>

Due: <b>Friday, February 7, 2020</b> (11:30pm)

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to learn about
the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used by the World Wide Web.
In particular, you will design and implement an HTTP proxy (i.e., Web proxy)
with functionality that demonstrates both the simplicity and the power of HTTP
as an application-layer protocol.
Along the way, you will also learn a lot about
socket programming, TCP/IP, network debugging, and more.
</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>
The so-called "Fake News" phenomenon is rampant on the Internet,
but it seems unfair to let Donald Trump have all the fun,
so let's make some fake news of our own!
We are going to make a Web proxy that alters certain content
on simple Web pages before they are rendered by the Web browser,
so that the user sees factually incorrect information without knowing it.
To keep the assignment simple, we will restrict ourselves only to HTTP
(not HTTPS), and consider only basic text and HTML pages with a few images.
</p>

<p>
For our purpose, the fake news will involve my friend
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/Cute-Floppy.jpg"> Floppy</a>
from Italy.
Specifically, you need to change all occurrences of "Floppy" on a Web page
into "Trolly", and  all occurrences of "Italy" into "Japan".
And if you find any JPG images of Floppy (linked or embedded),
then you should replace them with your favourite
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/trollface.jpg"> troll</a>
image file (JPG, GIF, or PNG) from the Internet. Woot!!
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
A <b>Web proxy</b> is a piece of software that functions as an
intermediary between a Web client (browser) and a Web server.
The Web proxy intercepts Web requests from clients and reformulates
the requests for transmission to a Web server. When a
response is received from the Web server, the proxy sends the 
response back to the client.
From the server's point of view, the proxy <b>is</b> the client,
since that is where the request comes from.
Similarly, from the client's point of view, the proxy <b>is</b> the server,
since that is where the response comes from.
A Web proxy thus provides a single point of control to regulate 
Internet access between clients and servers. 
A lot of Calgary schools use Web proxies to limit the types of
Web sites that students are allowed to access.
<a href="http://www.netnanny.com/"> Net Nanny</a> and
<a href="http://www.barracuda.com/"> Barracuda</a>
are examples of commercially available Web proxies.
</p>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>

<p>
In this assignment, you will implement your very own <b>Web proxy</b>,
in either C or C++.
The goals of the assignment are to build a properly functioning
Web proxy for simple Web pages, and then use your proxy
to change some of the content before it is delivered to the browser.
</p>

<p>
There are two main pieces of functionality needed in your proxy.
The first is the ability to intercept (and parse) HTTP requests and responses,
so that the proxy can determine what changes (if any) need to be made to the
requested content.
The second is the ability to insert the false information into the
page in some appropriate way so that the page still renders properly.
Think of the fun you can have by trolling your unsuspecting roommate
with fake news via your proxy. Hahahahaha!!!
</p>

<p>
The most important HTTP command for your Web proxy to handle
is the "GET" request, which specifies the URL for an object
to be retrieved. In the basic operation of your proxy, it
should be able to parse, understand, and forward to the Web
server a (possibly modified) version of the client HTTP request.
Similarly, the proxy should be able to parse, understand, 
and return to the client a (possibly modified) version
of the HTTP response that the Web server provided to the proxy.
Please give some careful thought to how your proxy handles
commonly occurring HTTP response codes, such as
200 (OK),
206 (Partial Content),
301 (Moved Permanently),
302 (Found),
304 (Not Modified),
403 (Forbidden),
and
404 (Not Found).
</p>

<p>
You will need at least one TCP socket (i.e., SOCK_STREAM) for client-proxy
communication, and at least one additional TCP socket for each Web server
you are talking to for proxy-server communication.
(If you want your proxy to support
multiple concurrent HTTP transactions, you will
need to fork child processes for request handling as well.
See optional bonus part below.)
Each child process or thread will use its own socket instances for its
communications with the client and with the server.
</p>

<p>
When implementing your proxy, feel free to
compile and run your Web proxy on any suitable department machine,
or even your home machine or laptop, but please be aware that you
will ultimately have to demo your proxy to your TA on campus at some point.
You should try to access your proxy from your favourite Web browser
(e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Safari),
and computer (either on campus or at home).
To test the proxy, you will have to
configure your Web browser to use your specific Web proxy
(e.g., look for menu selections like Tools, Internet Options, Proxies, Advanced, LAN Settings).
</p>

<p>
As you design and build your Web proxy, give careful consideration
to how you will debug and test it. For example, you may want to
print out
information about requests and responses received, processed, forwarded,
redirected, or altered.
Once you become confident with the basic operation of your Web proxy,
you can toggle off the verbose debugging output.
If you are testing on your home network, you can also use tools
like 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark"> WireShark</a>
or
<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/"> tcpdump</a>
to collect network packet traces.
By studying the HTTP messages and TCP/IP packets going to and from your proxy,
you might be able to figure out what is working, what isn't working, and why.
</p>

<p>
When you are finished,
please submit your solution in electronic form to your TA via D2L.
Your submission should include the source code for your Web proxy,
a brief user manual describing how to compile and use your proxy,
and a description of the testing done with your proxy.
Please remember that assignments are to be done individually,
and submitted to your assigned TA on time.
You should also plan to give a brief demo of your proxy to your TA in February,
either just before or just after your submission.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
Your proxy will be tested on the following six test cases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/testpage0.txt"> simple ASCII text file</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/testpage0.html"> simple HTML test page</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/testpage01.html"> HTML test page with link to photo</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/testpage1.html"> HTML test page with 1 embedded photo</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/testpage2.html"> HTML test page with 2 embedded photos</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/testpage3.html"> HTML test page with 3 embedded photos</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once you have these cases working, you can try your proxy on other pages,
such as the Wikipedia pages for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"> Italy</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk"> Floppy Disks</a>,
to see what happens. 
Good luck, and have fun!
</p>

<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>

<p>
The grading scheme for the assignment is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>16 marks</b>
for the
design and implementation of a functional Web proxy that
can handle simple HTTP GET interactions between client and server,
using either HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.  This basic proxy should be
able to deliver Web pages in unaltered form, and be able to
handle HTTP redirection when it occurs. 
Your implementation should include 
proper use of TCP/IP socket programming in C or C++,
and reasonably commented code.
</li>
<li>
<b>10 marks</b>
for that part of your Web proxy that can parse HTTP requests and responses,
identify when text, HTML, and JPG files are being requested, and make proper
decisions about content alteration.
</li>
<li>
<b>4 marks</b>
for a
clear and concise user manual (at most 1 page)
that describes how to compile, configure, and
use your Web proxy.
Make sure to indicate the required features 
and optional features (if any) that the proxy supports.
Make sure to clarify where and how the testing was done
(e.g., home, university, office), what works, and what does not. Be honest!
</li>
<li>
<b>10 marks</b>
for a suitable demonstration of your proxy
to your TA in your tutorial section, or to your professor at a mutually 
convenient time. A successful demo will include marks for the test cases
 above,
as well as clear answers to questions asked during your code 
walk-through.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus (optional)</h2>

<p>
Up to <b>2 bonus marks</b> will be
given for proper design of a non-blocking
(i.e., multi-threaded or multi-process) proxy
that can handle complicated Web sites with ease.
Make sure to show this during the demo.
</p>
<p>
Up to <b>2 bonus marks</b> will be
given for a version of the proxy that can change each
occurrence of "Italy" into "Germany".
</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>
This is a <b>very challenging</b> assignment, so please <b>get started early</b>.
You will likely need 7-14 days of thinking/coding/debugging time to
get it fully working.
</li>
<li>
If you have never done socket programming in C/C++ before, you should
make sure to get to your CPSC 441 tutorials on this topic. Don't miss them!
</li>
<li>
If you don't speak HTTP already,
make sure to get to your CPSC 441 tutorial on this topic.
For example,
the "Content-Type" header is a good way to determine the type of a Web object,
and the "Content-Length" header will tell you how big it is (in bytes).
</li>
<li>
Focus on the basic HTTP proxy functionality first,
by simply forwarding everything that you receive from the client
directly to the server, and everything you receive from the server
directly back to the client. Then add more functionality,
such as text parsing, content alteration, request alteration,
and/or HTTP redirection.
</li>
<li>
Your proxy will need one socket for talking to the client,
and another socket for talking to the server. Make sure to keep track
of which one is which. This is very important to understand!
</li>
<li>
Your proxy will likely
need to dynamically create a socket for every new server that it talks to.
Most of the examples above involve only one server, which is easier.
But you will likely need to generalize this to multiple servers.
If so, make sure to manage these sockets properly.
</li>
<li>
Start with <b>very simple</b> Web pages, such as those indicated above.
Once you have these working, then you can try more complicated Web pages
with lots of embedded objects, possibly from multiple servers.
</li>
<li>
You may find that network firewalls block certain ports, which may make
configuration and use of your proxy tricky. For example, I found it easier to do
all of my testing using machines within the CPSC network, rather than external ones.
A good Wireshark trace can help show you what is actually happening on the network.
</li>
<li>
Try to avoid servers that automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS,
since TLS handshakes and encrypted content are well beyond the
intended scope of the assignment.
Let's keep things simple with HTTP only.
